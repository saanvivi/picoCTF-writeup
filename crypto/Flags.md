<p> Feeeling very confused initially, I tried deciphering the flags myself. Knowing the format picoCTF{}, I figured some letters but couldnt make sense of it. I googled "flag cipher" which lead me to the International maritime signal flags. So i was able to decode the flag. </p>

The flag is `picoCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`
