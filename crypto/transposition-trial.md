# Q. transposition-trial

## Description:
>Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.

As the description suggests, every block of three got scrambled around. Figuring that the first few words are "The flag is", it was easy to notice that for every block, the last letter is to be made the first to unscramble it. This bring us to the flag.

The flag is `picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_56E6924A}`
